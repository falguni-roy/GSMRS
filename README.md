**A Closer Look on Gender Stereotypes in Movie Recommender Systems and Their Implications with Privacy**

**Setup:**

You must have the MovieLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) & yahoo movie data (https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/) downloaded in your project.

**Gender Inference**

The basic gender inference attack can be executed by running the Classifier_Gender.py. In the file, you can define what exactly should be executed. I.e.,
1. To load the rating and gender data of MovieLens, call the load_ratingdata_ML() & load_genderdata_ML() function
2. To execute, for example logistic regression classifier, call classifierLR() function
3. To run logistic regression in cross validation function, call crossvalidation().
